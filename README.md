## Description
When initiating an open-source project on GitHub, crafting a well-crafted README is crucial. It should encompass the application's objectives, instructions on utilizing the app, guidance on installation, reporting issues, and providing insights on how others can contribute. This final aspect significantly enhances the chances of attracting contributions from fellow developers and ensuring the project's success. This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from user input using the Inquirer package.
